## üìã About DDS

Deception Detection System is a hybrid tool that combines a Honeypot and an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Built in Go, it offers a lightweight approach to cybersecurity. This tool attracts attackers using deception techniques while detecting their actions in real-time. You can log malicious probes, scanning activities, and suspicious payloads without executing them. DDS is perfect for research purposes, creating blacklists, and increasing intrusion awareness.
